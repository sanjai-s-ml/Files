# Sessions 1-2｜4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

**Object** refers to real-world entities like a Car, Bike, Dog, etc.  
An object has two main components:

* Properties (variables)
* Behaviors (methods)

## Abstraction

* It hides the internal implementation and exposes only the essential functionality to the user.
* It can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
* Examples:
    * Cellphone: Making a call is abstracted. Users press a button, not concerned with how the call connects.
    * Car: Pressing the brake slows the car, but the internal workings of the braking system are hidden from the driver.

### Advantages

* Increases security and confidentiality.

## Encapsulation

* Encapsulation bundles the data and the code working on that data into a single unit, also known as **data hiding**.

### To achieve Encapsulation

* Declare a variable in a class as private.
* Provide public getter and setter methods to modify and view the value of the variable.

### Advantages

* Loosely coupled code.
* Better access control and security.

## Inheritance

* Inheritance is the capability of a class to inherit properties and methods from its parent class.
* It allows the child class to reuse code from the parent class, so we do not have to write the same code again.
* It can be achieved using the `extends` keyword or through an interface.

### Types of Inheritance

* Single Inheritance
    * A child class derives properties and behaviors from a single parent class.
* Multilevel Inheritance
    * A class inherits from a base class, and then another class inherits from that derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.
* Hierarchical Inheritance
    * One superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses, creating a hierarchical structure.
* Multiple Inheritance
    * When a class extends more than one superclass, it's known as multiple inheritance.
    * It is not supported directly in Java.
    * Instead, it utilizes interfaces as a mechanism to achieve similar behavior and to overcome the [diamond problem](https://www.prepbytes.com/blog/java/diamond-problem-in-java/).

### Advantages

* Code reusability.
* Allows achieving polymorphism.

## Polymorphism

* Polymorphism means "many forms".
* The same method behaves differently in different situations.
* Example:
    * A person can be a father, husband, employee, and brother.

### Types of Polymorphism

* Compile-Time Polymorphism/Static Polymorphism/Method Overloading
    * Methods with the same name and return type but different parameter lists.
* Run-Time Polymorphism/Dynamic Polymorphism/Method Overriding
    * A method in a child class overrides the implementation (body) of a method in its parent class.
* Operator overloading is not supported in Java.

## Object Relationships

* Is-a Relationship
    * Achieved through inheritance.
    * Inheritance establishes an "is-a" relationship between parent and child classes.
    * Example: 
        * A `DOG` is an `ANIMAL`.
* Has-a Relationship
    * When an object is used within another class.
    * These relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.
    * Examples:
        * A `School` has `Students`.
        * A `Bike` has an `Engine`.
    * Association: A general relationship between two distinct objects.
        * **Aggregation**: Both objects can exist independently. The lifecycle of one object does not depend on the other.
            * A `Library` can exist without the `Books`, and the `Books` can exist outside of the `Library`.
        * **Composition**: The existence of one object depends on the other. The end of one object will end the other object. 
            * If a `House` is destroyed, its `Rooms` are also destroyed because they cannot exist independently.

🎥 [JVM Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd3UqWTnYXOnVHiu8QQ145TEVArfV3D_3) – Durga sir

Java is a platform-independent, highly portable language—write once, run anywhere (WORA).

* **JDK**: Java Development Kit (includes JRE, language syntax, compiler, debugger).
* **JRE**: Java Runtime Environment (includes JVM and standard libraries).
* **JVM**: Java Virtual Machine (platform dependent).

JDK and JRE are platform-dependent because they contain the platform-specific JVM. However, the resulting Java bytecode is platform-independent and executes on any system with a compatible JVM.

# Session 4｜main Method

🎥 Explanation of `public static void main(String[] args) {}` – Durga sir

* [PART- I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by58arnoV4c)
* [PART- II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0SdH2Dtrnw)
* [PART- III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzRSGCFz8rA)

```java
// Hello.java
public class Hello {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World");
  }
}
```

The `main` method is the entry point for a Java program. The JVM calls the `main` method because it needs to start the program execution. Since the method is `static`, the JVM can invoke it without creating an instance of the class.

If a Java file contains multiple `public` classes, the JVM wouldn't know which class to call for the `main` method. Therefore, Java enforces a restriction that at most one `public` class can exist per `.java` file, and if a class is declared `public`, that class must have the same name as the file.

# Sessions 5-7｜Data Types and Variables

A variable is a named container used to store a value.

* The name can start with `$`, `_`, or letters (a-z, A-Z), including Unicode characters but **not** with numbers.
* Variable names are case-sensitive. `int A` and `int a` are treated as two different variables.
* Reserved words cannot be used as variable names.
* For multi-word variable names, the camelCase convention is typically used
* Constants should be written in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_VALUE).

## Primitive Data Types

* **byte**: 1 byte, default `0`
* **short**: 2 bytes, default `0`
* **char**: 2 bytes, default `'\u0000'`
* **int**: 4 bytes, default `0`
* **float**: 4 bytes, default `0.0F`
* **long**: 8 bytes, default `0L`
* **double**: 8 bytes, default `0.0`
* **boolean**: N/A, default `false`

The declaration `int x;` is allowed at the class level with a default value of `0`. However, declaring `int x;` inside a method causes a compilation error because local variables must be initialized before use.

```java
class MyClass {
  int x; // instance variable
  static int staticVariable; // static variable

  public void display() {
    System.out.println(x);  // 0
  }

  public void myMethod() {
    int z;  // local variable
    System.out.println(z);  // Compilation error: variable 'z' might not have been initialized
  }
}
```

### Variable Types

* **Local**: Declared within a method or block.
* **Instance**: Declared within a class but outside any method; unique to each instance of the class.
* **Static/Class**: Declared with the `static` keyword; shared among all instances of the class.
* **Method Parameters**: Variables passed to methods.
* **Constructor Parameters**: Variables passed to constructors.

### Types of Conversion

* **Automatic Conversion**: Implicit conversion, often from a smaller type to a larger type (e.g., `int` to `long`).
* **Narrowing/Down Casting/Explicit Conversion**: Explicit conversion from a larger type to a smaller type (e.g., `double` to `int`).
* **Promotion During Expression**: Temporary conversion of types during expression evaluation (e.g., in arithmetic operations).
* **Explicit Casting During Expression**: Manually specifying the type conversion during expression evaluation.

```java
// Automatic Conversion
int i = 10;
long l = i; // int to long Conversion

// Narrowing Conversion
double d = 9.75;
int x = (int) d; // double to int conversion 

// Promotion During Expression
int a = 5;
float b = 10.5f;
float result = a + b; // Promotion of int to float

// Explicit Casting During Expression
double e = 20.99;
int y = (int) (a + e);  // double to int Casting
```

## Reference Data Types

`null` is the default value for any object type, can't be applied to primitive types.

* **Class**: Custom data types defined by user.
* **String**: Represents a sequence of characters.
* **Interface**: Defines a contract that classes can implement.
* **Array**: A collection of elements of the same type.

> In Java, Everything is [pass by value](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-is-pass-by-value-and-not-pass-by-reference)

For primitive data types, **pass-by-value** means that when you pass a variable to a method, a copy of the value is made. The original value remains unchanged in the calling method, even if the value is modified within the method.

For reference types, **pass-by-value** means a copy of the object's memory address is passed—not the object itself. This allows methods to modify the object's fields. However, the method only has a copy of the address. So, if inside the method you try to make that address point to a completely different object, it won't affect the original address you had in the first place. Your original variable will still point to the same object it did before the method was called.

### String Constant Pool

In Java, [String Constant Pool](https://www.baeldung.com/java-string-constant-pool-heap-stack) is a special region within the heap memory that stores string literals. When a string is created using a literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, the new reference points to the existing string, avoiding duplication and optimizing memory usage.

```java
String s1 = "Hello"; // string literal
String s2 = new String("Hello"); // object

System.out.println(s1 == s2); // false [memory address is different]
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true
```

## Wrapper Classes

🎥 [Java Wrapper Classes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR1BXeBj1huvzSCIF7mVWaTsoAlCEkqOf) – Durga sir

### Types

#### Autoboxing

Automatically converts primitive types to their corresponding wrapper classes. The 8 primitive types have respective reference classes.

* `int` ↔ `Integer`
* `float` ↔ `Float`
* `double` ↔ `Double`
* `byte` ↔ `Byte`
* `char` ↔ `Character`
* `long` ↔ `Long`
* `boolean` ↔ `Boolean`
* `short` ↔ `Short`

Example:

```java
int x = 10;
Integer y = x;  // Autoboxing
```

#### Unboxing

Automatically converts wrapper classes back to their corresponding primitive types.

* `Integer` ↔ `int`
* `Float` ↔ `float`
* `Double` ↔ `double`
* `Byte` ↔ `byte`
* `Character` ↔ `char`
* `Long` ↔ `long`
* `Boolean` ↔ `boolean`
* `Short` ↔ `short`

Example:

```java
Integer x = 5;
int y = x;  // Unboxing
```

Java Collections work with reference objects, not primitive types. Primitive types are stored in stack memory, whereas reference types are stored in heap memory.

Example:

```java
ArrayList<Integer> arr2 = new ArrayList<Integer>();
```

# Sessions 8-9｜Methods

* A method is a named block of code designed to execute a specific task.
* Method enhance code readability and reusability.

```java
public int sum(int a, int b) throws Exception {}
``` 

## Access Modifiers

* **Private:** The access level of a private modifier is restricted to within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
* **Default:** The access level of a default modifier is limited to within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If no access level is specified, the default modifier is used.
* **Protected:** The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through the child classes. If no subclass is created, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.
* **Public:** The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package, and outside the package.

## Return Type

* If a method doesn't return any value, its return type is declared as `void`.
* Otherwise, the return type can be either a primitive data type or the name of a class.

## Method Name

* Names should be verbs that describe an action.
* They should begin with a lowercase letter and use camelCase for multi-word names.

## Parameters

* Parameters are variables passed to a method to provide input.
* A method can have zero or more parameters.

## Method Body

* The method body contains the code to be executed when the method is called.
* It ends either when a `return` statement is executed or when the closing brace is reached.
* In `void` methods, you can use `return;` to exit early without returning a value.

## Method Types

* **System-Defined Methods:** Predefined methods provided by Java, such as `Math.sqrt()`.
* **User-Defined Methods:** Custom methods created by the programmer to perform specific tasks based on the program’s needs.
* **Overloaded Methods:** Methods within the same class that share the same name but differ in their parameter lists. Overloading is determined by method arguments—not by return type.
* **Overridden Methods:** When a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that already exists in its superclass, using the same method signature (name and return type). Overriding enables runtime (dynamic) polymorphism.
* **Static Methods:**
  * Belong to the class rather than instances of the class.
  * Can be called directly using the class name.
  * Cannot access non-static instance variables or methods.
  * Cannot be overridden. `@Override` is for dynamic binding, whereas `static` is for compile-time polymorphism.
  * When to use static methods:
      * If the method does not depend on instance data.
      * For utility or helper methods.
        * Example: Factory design pattern.
      * When the method performs a general task based solely on its input parameters.
    
## Abstract Method

* Abstract methods can only be declared within abstract classes.
* They contain only the method signature—no body or implementation.
* Subclasses are responsible for providing the method's implementation.

```java
abstract class Animal {
  public abstract void sound(); 
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  public void sound() {
    System.out.println("Meow");
  }
}
```

## Variable Arguments (varargs)

* Allows a method to accept a variable number of arguments.
* Only one varargs parameter is allowed per method.
* It must be the last parameter in the method’s parameter list.
* Declared using the syntax: `type... variableName`.

```java
public static void printNumbers(int... numbers) {
  for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
  }
}
```

## Final Method

* A method declared with the `final` keyword cannot be overridden by subclasses.
  * Why? A `final` method means its implementation remains unchanged.

```java
public final void hello() {
  System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

# Session 10｜Constructor

📘 [A Guide to Constructors in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-constructors) – Baeldung  
📘 [Java Constructors vs Static Factory Methods](https://www.baeldung.com/java-constructors-vs-static-factory-methods) – Baeldung

At runtime, the `new` keyword calls a constructor to create an object. A child class does not inherit the constructor of its parent class. The `super()` call is used to invoke the parent class's constructor before executing the child class's constructor.

A constructor is used to create an instance and initialize instance variables. It is similar to a method, except:

* The constructor's name must match the class name.
* A constructor does not have a return type.
* A constructor cannot be declared as `static`, `final`, `abstract`, or `synchronized`.

```java
public class Car {
  String make;

  public Car(String make) {
    this.make = make;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car myCar = new Car("Toyota");
    System.out.println(myCar.make);
  }
}
```

## Types of Constructor

* Default Constructor
* No-arguments Constructor
* Parameterized Constructor
* Constructor Overloading
* Private Constructor
* Constructor Chaining
  * `this()`
  * `super()`

```java
// no-args constructor
ConstructorExample() { ... }
    
// parameterized
ConstructorExample1(String message) { ... }

// overloading
ConstructorExample1(String message, int num) { ... }

// private
private ConstructorExample2(boolean flag) { ... }

// super() chaining
ConstructorExample3() {
  super(); // calls the superclass constructor [parent]
}

// this chaining
class Employee {
  String name;
  int empID;

  Employee() {
    this(empID);
  }

  Employee(int empID) {
    this("AB", empID);
  }

  Employee(String name, int empID) {
    this.name = name;
    this.empID = empID;
  }
}
```

## Frequently asked Interview Questions on Constructor

* Why constructors do not have a return type? 
  * Constructors do not have a return type because their primary purpose is to instantiate and initialize objects, not to return a value.
* Why constructors cannot be final?
  * A `final` method cannot be overridden. If a constructor were `final`, it would prevent any subclass from modifying the constructor, which defeats the purpose of subclassing and initialization.
* Why constructor can not be abstract?
  * Abstract methods are declared without implementation and must be implemented by subclasses. Since constructors are used to instantiate and initialize objects, having an abstract constructor is meaningless—it must always have an implementation.
* Why constructor can not be static?
  * Static methods belong to the class rather than any instance and cannot access instance variables. Since constructors are responsible for initializing instance variables, they cannot be `static`.
* Can you define a constructor in an interface?
  * No, constructors cannot be defined in an interfaces because interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.
* Why is the constructor name the same as the class name?
  * This convention ensures that constructors are easily identifiable and distinguishes them from regular methods, enhancing code readability and consistency.

# Session 11｜Memory Management

📘 [Memory Management in Java Interview Questions (+Answers)](https://www.baeldung.com/java-memory-management-interview-questions) – Baeldung  
📘 [Static Fields and Garbage Collection](https://www.baeldung.com/java-static-fields-gc) – Baeldung

## Types of Memory

* Stack Memory
* Heap Memory

### Stack Memory

* Stores temporary variables and has a separate memory block for methods.
* Stores primitive data types.
* Stores references to heap objects:
  * Strong reference 
    * The `Object obj = new Object();` will not be garbage collected as long as the reference exists. 
  * Weak reference
    * A reference that allows the object to be garbage collected if there are no strong references.
    * `WeakReference<MyObject> weakRef = new WeakReference<>(new MyObject());` 
  * Soft reference
    * It allows an object to be garbage collected only when memory is low.
    * `SoftReference<MyObject> softRef = new SoftReference<>(new MyObject());`
* Each thread has its own stack.
* Variables are visible only within the scope in which they are defined. Once a variable goes out of scope, it is removed from the stack (in LIFO order).
* If the stack is full, a `java.lang.StackOverflowError` is thrown.

### Heap Memory

* Used to store objects.
* There is no fixed order for allocating memory. Memory is dynamically allocated.
* The [Garbage Collector](https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-garbage-collectors) is used to delete unreferenced objects from the heap.
* The [Mark and Sweep](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs330/f13/Public/garbageCollection/garbageCollection-htmlsu5.html) algorithm is used during garbage collection.
* Types of Garbage Collectors:
  * Serial Garbage Collector
    * Single-threaded; causes noticeable application pauses during cleanup.
  * Parallel Garbage Collector
    * Multi-threaded; reduces pause time by running GC in parallel.
  * CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep)
    * GC runs alongside application threads, minimizing pause duration.
  * G1 (Garbage-First)
    * Focuses on short pauses and high throughput; ideal for large heaps.
* Heap memory is shared among all threads.
* Heap also contains the String Pool.
* If the heap memory is full, a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` is thrown.

#### Heap Memory Structure

* Young Generation (minor garbage collection occurs)
  * Eden: Where new objects are initially created.
  * Survivor Spaces (S0, S1): Hold objects that survive garbage collection in Eden.
* Old Generation (major garbage collection occurs)
  * Objects that have survived a certain age in the Young Generation are moved here.

## Outside of Heap

* Permanent Generation (PermGen)
  * Used in earlier Java versions (before Java 8).
  * Stored class metadata and static variables.
  * Replaced by [MetaSpace](https://www.baeldung.com/java-permgen-metaspace)
* MetaSpace
  * Introduced in Java 8 to replace PermGen.
  * Stores class metadata.
  * Grows automatically as needed, using native memory rather than heap space.
class Person {
    private int empId;

    Person(int empId) {
        this.empId = empId;
    }

    public int getEmpId() {
        return this.empId;
    }
}

class MemoryManagement {
    public void hello() {
        int primitiveVariable = 10;
        String stringLiteral = "Hello, World";
    }

    public void memoryManagementTest(Person personObj) {
        Person personObj2 = personObj;
        String stringLiteral2 = "Hello, World";
        String stringLiteral3 = new String("Good luck with Java");

        System.out.println(stringLiteral3);
    }
}

Person personObj = new Person(10);
MemoryManagement memObj = new MemoryManagement();
memObj.memoryManagementTest(personObj);

# Session 26｜Control Flow Statements

## Decision Making Statements

* `if`
* `if/else`
* `if/else if/else`
* nested `if/else`
* `switch` statement
* `switch` expressions (Introduced in Java 12)

}

// if/else statement
if (num % 2 == 0) {
  System.out.println("The number is even.");
} else {
  System.out.println("The number is odd.");
}

// if/else if/else statement
if (num > 0) {

} else if (num < 0) {
  System.out.println("The number is negative.");
} else {
  System.out.println("The number is zero.");
}

// Nested if/else statement
if (num > 0) {
  if (num % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive and even.");
  } else {
    System.out.println("The number is positive and odd.");
  }
} else {
  System.out.println("The number is not positive.");
}
```

### Switch Statement

📘 [What are switch expressions and how are they different from switch statements?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65657169/what-are-switch-expressions-and-how-are-they-different-from-switch-statements) – Stackovrflow  
📘 [Java Switch Statement](https://www.baeldung.com/java-switch) – Baeldung  
📘 [Pattern Matching for Switch](https://www.baeldung.com/java-switch-pattern-matching) – Baeldung

#### Key Points

* Case values must be unique; two cases cannot have the same value.
* The data type of the switch expression must match the data types of the case values/constants.
* Case values must be either LITERAL or CONSTANT.
* Not all use cases need to be handled.
* Nested switch statements are allowed.
* A `return` cannot be used directly from a switch statement.
  * However, two methods are available to achieve this (Java 12 and later):
    * Using the `case N ➝` label.
    * Using the `yield` statement.
* Supported Data Types
  * 4 primitive types: `int`, `short`, `byte`, and `char`
  * Wrapper types for the above primitives: `Integer`, `Character`, `Byte`, and `Short`
  * `Enum`
  * `String`

#### Statement Syntax

```java
switch (expression) {
  case value_1:
    // code
    break;
  case value_2:
    // code
    break;
  case value_3:
    // code
    break;
  default:
    // code
}
```
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

        break;
    case 20:
        System.out.println("a + b = %d".formatted(20));
        break;
    case 30:
        System.out.println("a + b = %d".formatted(30));
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println(a + b);

### Switch Expressions

🎥 [Java Switch Expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_FzCzu6VMI) – Nagoor Babu Sir  
📘 [Guide to the yield Keyword in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-yield-switch) – Baeldung

#### Expression Syntax

```java
type val = switch (expression) {
  case value -> {
    yield value;
  }
  case value -> return value;
  default -> {
    yield value;
  }
};
```

#### Rules

* All cases must be handled, either explicitly with `case` or by a `default` block.
* You cannot have a block of statements after the arrow (➝). It's a single expression per case.
* If you want to use a block of statements for a `case` and return a value, you must use the `yield` keyword.
int val = 1;

String outputval = switch(val) {
    case 1 -> "One";
    case 2 -> "Two";
    case 3 -> "Three";
    default -> "None";
};

System.out.println(outputval);
int val = 3;

// All possible use cases must be handled for the expression.
// Adding a default case fixes this issue.
String outputval = switch(val) {
    case 1 -> "One";
    case 2 -> "Two";
    case 3 -> "Three";
};

System.out.println(outputval);
public enum Day {
    SUNDAY,
    MONDAY,
    TUESDAY,
    WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY,
    FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY;
}

Day today = Day.FRIDAY;

String output = switch(today) {
    case SUNDAY -> "Weekend";
    case MONDAY -> "Workday";
    case FRIDAY -> {
        yield "Prayer Day";
    }
    default -> today.toString();
};

System.out.println(output);
int val = 3;

String outputval = switch(val) {
    case 1 -> {
        // code
        yield "One";
    }
    case 2 -> {
        // code
        yield "Two";
    }
    case 3 -> {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 20;
        System.out.println(x + y);
        yield "Three";
    }
    default -> {
        // code
        yield "None";
    }
};

System.out.println(outputval);
## Iterative Statements

* `for` loop
* `while` loop
* `do-while` loop
* `for-each` loop

### for-each loop

Primarily used to iterate over arrays or collections.
int values[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int val: values) {
    System.out.print(val + " ");
}
int values[] = new int[5];
values[0] = 1;
values[1] = 2;
values[2] = 3;

for (int val: values) {
    System.out.print(val + " ");
}
### For loop

```java
for (variable; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // code
}
```
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i += 1) {
    System.out.print(i + " ");
}
for (int x = 1; x <= 3; x++) {
    for (int y = 1; y <= 3; y++) {
        System.out.println("x=" + x + " : y=" + y);
    }
}
### While loop

```java
type var = 1;

while (condition) {
  // code
  var += 1;
}
```
int val = 5;

while (val >= 1) {
    System.out.print(val + " ");
    val -= 1;
}
### Do-while loop

```java
type var = 1;

do {
  // code
  val += 1;
} while (condittion);
```
int val = 5;

do {
    System.out.print(val + " ");
    val -= 1;
} while (val >= 1);
## Branching Statements

* `break` statement
* `continue` statement
// The break statement exits the current loop and transfers control to the next statement.
for (int x = 1; x <= 3; x++) {
    for (int y = 1; y <= 3; y++) {
        if (x == 2) {
            break;
        }
        System.out.println("x=" + x + " : y=" + y);
    }
}
for (int x = 1; x <= 3; x++) {
    for (int y = 1; y <= 3; y++) {
        if (x == 1) {
            continue;
        }
        System.out.println("x=" + x + " : y=" + y);
    }
}
// This instructs the JVM to transfer control to the end of the specified labeled loop 
// rather than exiting only the innermost loop.

outerLoop: for (int x = 1; x <= 3; x++) {
    innerLoop: for (int y = 1; y <= 3; y++) {
        if (x == 2) {
            break outerLoop;
        }
        System.out.println("x=" + x + " : y=" + y);
    }
}
Outer: for (int x = 1; x <= 3; x++) {
    Inner: for (int y = 1; y <= 3; y++) {
        if (x == 1) {
            continue Outer;
        }
        System.out.println("x=" + x + " : y=" + y);
    }
}
