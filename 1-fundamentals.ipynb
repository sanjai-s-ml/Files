    "# Sessions 1-2｜4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object** refers to real-world entities like a Car, Bike, Dog, etc.  \n",
    "An object has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Properties (variables)\n",
    "* Behaviors (methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "* It hides the internal implementation and exposes only the essential functionality to the user.\n",
    "* It can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "    * Cellphone: Making a call is abstracted. Users press a button, not concerned with how the call connects.\n",
    "    * Car: Pressing the brake slows the car, but the internal workings of the braking system are hidden from the driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increases security and confidentiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulation bundles the data and the code working on that data into a single unit, also known as **data hiding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To achieve Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Declare a variable in a class as private.\n",
    "* Provide public getter and setter methods to modify and view the value of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loosely coupled code.\n",
    "* Better access control and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inheritance is the capability of a class to inherit properties and methods from its parent class.\n",
    "* It allows the child class to reuse code from the parent class, so we do not have to write the same code again.\n",
    "* It can be achieved using the `extends` keyword or through an interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single Inheritance\n",
    "    * A child class derives properties and behaviors from a single parent class.\n",
    "* Multilevel Inheritance\n",
    "    * A class inherits from a base class, and then another class inherits from that derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "* Hierarchical Inheritance\n",
    "    * One superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses, creating a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "* Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "    * When a class extends more than one superclass, it's known as multiple inheritance.\n",
    "    * It is not supported directly in Java.\n",
    "    * Instead, it utilizes interfaces as a mechanism to achieve similar behavior and to overcome the [diamond problem](https://www.prepbytes.com/blog/java/diamond-problem-in-java/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code reusability.\n",
    "* Allows achieving polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polymorphism means \"many forms\".\n",
    "* The same method behaves differently in different situations.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "    * A person can be a father, husband, employee, and brother.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compile-Time Polymorphism/Static Polymorphism/Method Overloading\n",
    "    * Methods with the same name and return type but different parameter lists.\n",
    "* Run-Time Polymorphism/Dynamic Polymorphism/Method Overriding\n",
    "    * A method in a child class overrides the implementation (body) of a method in its parent class.\n",
    "* Operator overloading is not supported in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is-a Relationship\n",
    "    * Achieved through inheritance.\n",
    "    * Inheritance establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between parent and child classes.\n",
    "    * Example: \n",
    "        * A `DOG` is an `ANIMAL`.\n",
    "* Has-a Relationship\n",
    "    * When an object is used within another class.\n",
    "    * These relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.\n",
    "    * Examples:\n",
    "        * A `School` has `Students`.\n",
    "        * A `Bike` has an `Engine`.\n",
    "    * Association: A general relationship between two distinct objects.\n",
    "        * **Aggregation**: Both objects can exist independently. The lifecycle of one object does not depend on the other.\n",
    "            * A `Library` can exist without the `Books`, and the `Books` can exist outside of the `Library`.\n",
    "        * **Composition**: The existence of one object depends on the other. The end of one object will end the other object. \n",
    "            * If a `House` is destroyed, its `Rooms` are also destroyed because they cannot exist independently."

    "\n",
    "For reference types, **pass-by-value** means a copy of the object's memory address is passed—not the object itself. This allows methods to modify the object's fields. However, the method only has a copy of the address. So, if inside the method you try to make that address point to a completely different object, it won't affect the original address you had in the first place. Your original variable will still point to the same object it did before the method was called.\n",

    "### String Constant Pool\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, [String Constant Pool](https://www.baeldung.com/java-string-constant-pool-heap-stack) is a special region within the heap memory that stores string literals. When a string is created using a literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, the new reference points to the existing string, avoiding duplication and optimizing memory usage.\n",

    "#### Autoboxing\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatically converts primitive types to their corresponding wrapper classes. The 8 primitive types have respective reference classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `int` ↔ `Integer`\n",
    "* `float` ↔ `Float`\n",
    "* `double` ↔ `Double`\n",
    "* `byte` ↔ `Byte`\n",
    "* `char` ↔ `Character`\n",
    "* `long` ↔ `Long`\n",
    "* `boolean` ↔ `Boolean`\n",
    "* `short` ↔ `Short`\n",

    "## Access Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Private:** The access level of a private modifier is restricted to within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "* **Default:** The access level of a default modifier is limited to within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If no access level is specified, the default modifier is used.\n",
    "* **Protected:** The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through the child classes. If no subclass is created, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.\n",
    "* **Public:** The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package, and outside the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Return Type\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a method doesn't return any value, its return type is declared as `void`.\n",
    "* Otherwise, the return type can be either a primitive data type or the name of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Name\n",
    "\n",
    "* Names should be verbs that describe an action.\n",
    "* They should begin with a lowercase letter and use camelCase for multi-word names.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parameters are variables passed to a method to provide input.\n",
    "* A method can have zero or more parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Body\n",
    "\n",
    "* The method body contains the code to be executed when the method is called.\n",
    "* It ends either when a `return` statement is executed or when the closing brace is reached.\n",
    "* In `void` methods, you can use `return;` to exit early without returning a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Types\n",
    "\n",
    "* **System-Defined Methods:** Predefined methods provided by Java, such as `Math.sqrt()`.\n",
    "* **User-Defined Methods:** Custom methods created by the programmer to perform specific tasks based on the program’s needs.\n",
    "* **Overloaded Methods:** Methods within the same class that share the same name but differ in their parameter lists. Overloading is determined by method arguments—not by return type.\n",
    "* **Overridden Methods:** When a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that already exists in its superclass, using the same method signature (name and return type). Overriding enables runtime (dynamic) polymorphism.\n",
    "* **Static Methods:**\n",
    "  * Belong to the class rather than instances of the class.\n",
    "  * Can be called directly using the class name.\n",
    "  * Cannot access non-static instance variables or methods.\n",
    "  * Cannot be overridden. `@Override` is for dynamic binding, whereas `static` is for compile-time polymorphism.\n",
    "  * When to use static methods:\n",
    "      * If the method does not depend on instance data.\n",
    "      * For utility or helper methods.\n",
    "        * Example: Factory design pattern.\n",
    "      * When the method performs a general task based solely on its input parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Abstract Method\n",
    "\n",
    "* Abstract methods can only be declared within abstract classes.\n",
    "* They contain only the method signature—no body or implementation.\n",
    "* Subclasses are responsible for providing the method's implementation.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Variable Arguments (varargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Allows a method to accept a variable number of arguments.\n",
    "* Only one varargs parameter is allowed per method.\n",
    "* It must be the last parameter in the method’s parameter list.\n",

    "## Final Method\n",
    "\n",
    "* A method declared with the `final` keyword cannot be overridden by subclasses.\n",
    "  * Why? A `final` method means its implementation remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Frequently asked Interview Questions on Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why constructors do not have a return type? \n",
    "  * Constructors do not have a return type because their primary purpose is to instantiate and initialize objects, not to return a value.\n",
    "* Why constructors cannot be final?\n",
    "  * A `final` method cannot be overridden. If a constructor were `final`, it would prevent any subclass from modifying the constructor, which defeats the purpose of subclassing and initialization.\n",
    "* Why constructor can not be abstract?\n",
    "  * Abstract methods are declared without implementation and must be implemented by subclasses. Since constructors are used to instantiate and initialize objects, having an abstract constructor is meaningless—it must always have an implementation.\n",
    "* Why constructor can not be static?\n",
    "  * Static methods belong to the class rather than any instance and cannot access instance variables. Since constructors are responsible for initializing instance variables, they cannot be `static`.\n",
    "* Can you define a constructor in an interface?\n",
    "  * No, constructors cannot be defined in an interfaces because interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "* Why is the constructor name the same as the class name?\n",
    "  * This convention ensures that constructors are easily identifiable and distinguishes them from regular methods, enhancing code readability and consistency.\n",

    "## Types of Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stack Memory\n",
    "* Heap Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stores temporary variables and has a separate memory block for methods.\n",
    "* Stores primitive data types.\n",
    "* Stores references to heap objects:\n",
    "  * Strong reference \n",
    "    * The `Object obj = new Object();` will not be garbage collected as long as the reference exists. \n",
    "  * Weak reference\n",
    "    * A reference that allows the object to be garbage collected if there are no strong references.\n",
    "    * `WeakReference<MyObject> weakRef = new WeakReference<>(new MyObject());` \n",
    "  * Soft reference\n",
    "    * It allows an object to be garbage collected only when memory is low.\n",
    "    * `SoftReference<MyObject> softRef = new SoftReference<>(new MyObject());`\n",
    "* Each thread has its own stack.\n",
    "* Variables are visible only within the scope in which they are defined. Once a variable goes out of scope, it is removed from the stack (in LIFO order).\n",
    "* If the stack is full, a `java.lang.StackOverflowError` is thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heap Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used to store objects.\n",
    "* There is no fixed order for allocating memory. Memory is dynamically allocated.\n",
    "* The [Garbage Collector](https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-garbage-collectors) is used to delete unreferenced objects from the heap.\n",
    "* The [Mark and Sweep](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs330/f13/Public/garbageCollection/garbageCollection-htmlsu5.html) algorithm is used during garbage collection.\n",
    "* Types of Garbage Collectors:\n",
    "  * Serial Garbage Collector\n",
    "    * Single-threaded; causes noticeable application pauses during cleanup.\n",
    "  * Parallel Garbage Collector\n",
    "    * Multi-threaded; reduces pause time by running GC in parallel.\n",
    "  * CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep)\n",
    "    * GC runs alongside application threads, minimizing pause duration.\n",
    "  * G1 (Garbage-First)\n",
    "    * Focuses on short pauses and high throughput; ideal for large heaps.\n",
    "* Heap memory is shared among all threads.\n",
    "* Heap also contains the String Pool.\n",
    "* If the heap memory is full, a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` is thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Heap Memory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "* Young Generation (minor garbage collection occurs)\n",
    "  * Eden: Where new objects are initially created.\n",
    "  * Survivor Spaces (S0, S1): Hold objects that survive garbage collection in Eden.\n",
    "* Old Generation (major garbage collection occurs)\n",
    "  * Objects that have survived a certain age in the Young Generation are moved here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outside of Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "* Permanent Generation (PermGen)\n",
    "  * Used in earlier Java versions (before Java 8).\n",
    "  * Stored class metadata and static variables.\n",
    "  * Replaced by [MetaSpace](https://www.baeldung.com/java-permgen-metaspace)\n",
    "* MetaSpace\n",
    "  * Introduced in Java 8 to replace PermGen.\n",
    "  * Stores class metadata.\n",
    "  * Grows automatically as needed, using native memory rather than heap space."
